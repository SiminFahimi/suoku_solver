# Sudoku CSP Solver (Practice Project)

This is a **Sudoku solver** implemented in Python using **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** concepts.  
It uses **AC-3** for constraint propagation and **backtracking search** with MRV heuristic.

> **Note:** This project was done as a **practice exercise** to learn CSPs and Sudoku solving techniques.

The program will print:

-The initial Sudoku puzzle
-The solved Sudoku puzzle

Practice Goals:

Representing Sudoku as a CSP
Implementing AC-3 for constraint propagation
Using backtracking search with MRV heuristic

## How to run

Run the example file from the main project folder:

```bash
python src/example1.py
